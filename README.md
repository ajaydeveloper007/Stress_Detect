# Stress_Detect
Stress detection is a challenging task, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not. While looking for datasets that I can use to train a machine learning model for stress detection, I found a dataset on Kaggle with 116 columns. We only need to use the text and label column for this task.
